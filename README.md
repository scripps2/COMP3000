# Tabletop RPG Combat Companion App
**Supervisor:** Joseph Ross

### Vision  
Designed for unconfident or new players for Tabletop RPGs who want to create and run their own campaigns and events, but struggle with handling their combat encounters and keeping it engaging for their players. 

The Tabletop RPG Combat Companion is a web app that will provide a simple way for the user to dynamically alter a combat encounter, improving the experience for everyone involved in the game. The app will use a system of behaviours or traits for Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that are randomly assigned when the user creates an encounter, which will change the way the NPCs approach encounters and respond to player actions. With the traits being randomly assigned, multiple encounters of the same base can feel entirely different to each other and will help the user keep everyone engaged. 
The DMâ€™s flavour in a campaign is very important to the overall experience however, so the app is intended to be used to compliment the DM of a campaign and not replace. The responses from the app will be more ambiguous to allow the user to still add their own flavour to the actions taken without the experience feeling overly rigid, which will also allow the suggestions to be more flexible with their application.   

The app will also be designed to be still usable without utilising the dynamic traits, providing a clear and responsive UI to clearly display information about the encounter, and allow the user to easily edit data in the middle of the encounter, such as changes in health or available resources.
