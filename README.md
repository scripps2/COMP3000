## Main Ideas:

### Tabletop RPG Combat Companion App
An app to be used by the Dungeon Master (DM), main focus being to generate additional flavour for encounters in order to make combat feel more engaging. Randomly assigns traits or attributes to NPCs in encounters, and provide basic prompts for the DM to use based on the 

The app is aimed towards novice/unconfident DMs, and should be designed in a simple way to allow the DM to easily check details and edit values swiftly in response to game actions. The app can still be used without the trait system in order to help streamline the game, if the DM would prefer based on the encounter.  
 
### Time/Routine Management App
An app to provide help with time management and staying on track of upcoming commitments. It will provides easy event creation, and allows user-created "procedures" that can be assigned to new events upon creation. "Procedures" can allow the user to specify a sequence of reminders, alarms, or other features that can happen prior to the event, possibly requiring user input to ensure something is done if desired.
For example: 
 - Night before at "10:00PM": Push Notification - "Go to Bed"
 - 2 hours before: Alarm - "Wake up"
 - 1:30 hours before: Push Notification - "Breakfast"
 - 1 hour before: Push Notification - "Brush teeth"
 - 45 mins before: Push Notification - "Get dressed"
 - 30 mins before: Push Notification - "Check bag"
 - 15 mins before: Push Notification - "Check Whiteboard for Extra"
 - 5 mins before: Push Notification - "(Prepare to) Head out"
 - 0 mins: Push Notification - "Be out"

The app could utilise Google Maps API to find the distance between the users location (if they allow it) and the required location to calculate extra time required, and mark the "start" of the event earlier to allow the user to still arrive on time.
